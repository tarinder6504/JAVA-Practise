The Calendar class is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next week.

You are given a date. You just need to write the method, getDay, which returns the day on that date. To simplify your task, we have provided a portion of the code in the editor.

For example, if you are given the date 14  August 2017, the method should return as the MONDAY day on that date. 


Solution:-



import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
    public static String getDay(String day, String month, String year) {
        
        Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
        c.set(Integer.parseInt(year), Integer.parseInt(month)-1, Integer.parseInt(day));
        return(c.getDisplayName(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, Calendar.LONG, Locale.US).toUpperCase());
    }


 public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String month = in.next();
        String day = in.next();
        String year = in.next();
        
        System.out.println(getDay(day, month, year));
    }
}
