    "A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable." — Wikipedia: String (computer science)

This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:

String myString = "Hello World!"

The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.



Solution:-


import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        String A=sc.next();
        String B=sc.next();
        System.out.println(A.length()+B.length());
System.out.println(A.compareTo(B)>0?"Yes":"No");
System.out.println(A.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase()+A.substring(1, A.length())+" "+B.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase()+B.substring(1, B.length()));
        
    }
}
